I had a lot of fun last Thursday presenting at the [DC Ruby Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/).  I covered the basic background for A/B Split Testing, how to evaluate the results of a split test with [ABAnalyzer](https://github.com/livingsocial/abanalyzer).  I then went on to talk about the foundations for Multi-armed bandit optimization and covered the Rails gem [Bandit](https://github.com/bmuller/bandit).  

My slides from that talk can be found [here](/files/dcrug_presentation.pdf).

For some additional background, you can check out some of my old posts:

 * [Statistical Analysis and A/B Testing (Correctly)](http://findingscience.com/vanity/statistics/testing/2011/03/17/statistical-analysis-and-a-b-testing-correctly.html) : My rant on the many issues in [Vanity](https://github.com/assaf/vanity), which lead me to create ABAnalyzer
 * [A/B Test Analysis Library for Ruby](http://findingscience.com/ruby/statistics/testing/2010/12/19/a-b-test-analysis-library-for-ruby.html) : Initial description of ABAnalyzer
 * [Sample Size Calculations in Ruby](http://findingscience.com/statistics/ruby/2012/08/17/sample-size-calculations-in-ruby.html) : Demonstration of calculating sample sizes in Ruby
 * [Bandit: An A/B Testing Alternative for Rails](http://findingscience.com/rails/vanity/statistics/testing/2011/11/12/bandit:-a-b-testing-alternative-for-rails.html) : Initial description of the Bandit gem

The DC RUG is definitely a great group - you should go to one of their meetings if you haven't yet.
