You mention end to end product dev at the top with the nice list of items.  You should work that in somewhere in the bottom where your bios are just to reiterate it.  So when someone sees you they see Ui/UX/Product/Dev/Mobile Everything.  Maybe under "The Crew" Section it just lists in more generic way the end to end product experience.  You have that a bit with the Refreshing Design, Agile, Distribution and Operations etc.  I am just saying when I was looking at site in a bit  more plain English for the non-developers convey in non-technical speak you do the whole thing.
