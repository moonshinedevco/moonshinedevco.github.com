You mention end to end product dev at the top with the nice list of items.  You should work that in somewhere in the bottom where your bios are just to reiterate it.  So when someone sees you they see Ui/UX/Product/Dev/Mobile Everything.  Maybe under "The Crew" Section it just lists in more generic way the end to end product experience.  You have that a bit with the Refreshing Design, Agile, Distribution and Operations etc.  I am just saying when I was looking at site in a bit  more plain English for the non-developers convey in non-technical speak you do the whole thing.

 * change "The Crew" to "The Bootleggers"
 * add email addy to top of page
 * change ON-SITE TRAINING to ON-SITE TRAINING: Github/Ruby/Rails
 * figure out how to put github repos on page (or on a different page?) so people can see our code

===================
I've set up a branch called stationarynav to give you an idea of what I'm thinking for the stationary nav.

BTW - it's only in FF that the top github logo for the reserves is off center vertically.

I noticed you added some blog stuff to site.css - some of that overwrites what's in blog.css - we should probably combine or move blog.css.

The issue w/ the current "say hi" is that once you click it you see this:

So it's not clear what you're supposed to do next.  Maybe we should just have a "CONTACT" section at the bottom with a few options.
